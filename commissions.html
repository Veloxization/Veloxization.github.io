Use the URL <a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.paypal.me/velopaypal" href="https://www.paypal.me/velopaypal">paypal.me/velopaypal</a> to send payments.<br></p><p>Additional fees may be added if your request is especially complicated. I will always negotiate with you about additional fees if I feel like your piece will take longer than usual.<br></p><h3>Regarding refunds<br></h3><p>If you change your mind before I start drawing or you're not happy with the sketch, feel free to ask for a refund.<br></p><h3>Regarding WIPs<br></h3><p>To prevent art theft, I won't send WIPs before the payment has been processed and all WIPs will be watermarked and screenshots instead of full resolution image files.<br></p><p>By default, I will send a WIP after each stage but you can request as many as you want even mid-stage.<br></p><p>Please request any major changes to the line art before I start colouring. It's very difficult to edit anything major when the colour is already in.<br></p><h3>Regarding usage<br></h3><p>An art piece you bought can naturally be used in any way you like. I would, of course, appreciate credit if someone asks.<br></p><h3>What I will draw?<br></h3><p>In general, humans and anthros. Feel free to ask if I am able to do your specific request.<br></p><h3>What I won't draw?<br></h3><p>I won't take characters that don't have a reference sheet or an otherwise clear image I can use as a reference.<br></p>  </body>
